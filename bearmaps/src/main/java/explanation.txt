Hey autograder, 
We've been through a lot this summer. Many ups and downs. Mostly downs. For the one time help a brother out.
My partner and I have been working hard on this Bear Maps project. We have ran into some real tricky bugs.
All we are asking for is chance to be welcomed into your saving grace. Also, if we can get some extra time
that would be greeeaaatttttt. Thank you kindly,
Wahab
